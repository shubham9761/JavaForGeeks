            <p>Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).</p>
            <p>The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Object Oriented-</strong>
                    <p>In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Platform Independent-</strong>
                    <p>Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Simple-</strong>
                    <p>Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Secure</strong>
                    <p>With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption</p>
                </li>

            <p>Let us look at a simple code that will print the words Hello World.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

                        public static void main(String []args) {
                           System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
                        }

        <section class="main-section" id="Java_Identifiers">
            <header>Java Identifiers</header>
            <p>All Java components require names. Names used for classes, variables, and methods are called identifiers</p>
            <p>In Java, there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as follows-</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_).</li>
                <li>After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.</li>
                <li>A key word cannot be used as an identifier.</li>
                <li>Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.</li>
                <li>Examples of legal identifiers: age, $salary, _value, __1_value</li>
                <li>Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc, -salary.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Java_Enums">
            <header>Java Enums</header>
            <p>Enums were introduced in Java 5.0. Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums.</p>
            <p>With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code</p>
            <p>For example, if we consider an application for a fresh juice shop, it would be possible to restrict the glass size to small, medium, and large. This would make sure that it would not allow anyone to order any size other than small, medium, or large</p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    class FreshJuice {
                        enum FreshJuiceSize{ SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE }
                        FreshJuiceSize size;
                     }
                     
                     public class FreshJuiceTest {
                     
                        public static void main(String args[]) {
                           FreshJuice juice = new FreshJuice();
                           juice.size = FreshJuice.FreshJuiceSize.MEDIUM ;
                           System.out.println("Size: " + juice.size);
                        }
                     }

            <header>Constructors in Java</header>

            <p>When discussing about classes, one of the most important sub topic would be constructors. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class</p>
            <p>Each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule of constructors is that they should have the same name as the class. A class can have more than one constructor.</p>
            <p>Following is an example of a constructor</p>
            <h3>Example-</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    public class Puppy {
                        public Puppy() {
                        }
                     
                        public Puppy(String name) {
                           // This constructor has one parameter, name.
                        }
